![[Lucien Snow.png]]

A triton male of fair stature and stocky build. His most notable features are his hair, which is as blue as the deepest depths, and his eyes, which are as seering as his determination, with golden flecks like the sun. Lucien's complexion is akin to that of a pale silver under the light of the moon.

While he has reached the age of maturity, he is still naive to many of the aspects of the world. Further, his noble upbringing has caused this aspect of his personality to grow as he did.

He was 23 years of age, standing a modest 5'3", and weighing 170lbs when he left [[Lucien Adarbrent|House Adarbrent]] in the town of [[Luskan]] on the northern reaches of the Sword's Coast.
